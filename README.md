Use Protection!
---------------
MailRubber puts an extra layer of protection between your public email address and the world. Here's how it works:

* You put your email in
* MailRubber gives you a link to put in place of your email address (for forum signature, etc)
* When someone clicks the link, they have to prove they aren't a robot
* If they're human, they're shown your email address

What can MailRubber do?
-----------------------
* Stop dumb bots harvesting your email address
* Remove the need for having to format your email all silly trying to stop it from getting farmed

What can't MailRubber do?
-------------------------
* Prevent humans spamming you
